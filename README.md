### Status: Under development
This API is an alternative way to use the Underlords Leaderboards. Basicly I just Web Scrapped the original site and fetch and API from it.
This API is using the following libraries:
- [Request](https://github.com/request/request)
- [Cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio)
- [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express/)
